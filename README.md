# 🩻 CT Scan Diagnosis

## 🎯 Objective
Building a deep learning pipeline to **detect and classify diseases using CT scan images**, supporting radiologists in early diagnosis and treatment planning.

## 🩺 What We Do
 Preprocess CT scan images (resizing, normalization, noise reduction).  
 Label and organize images for supervised learning.  
 Train CNN models for classification of conditions (e.g., COVID-19, Pneumonia, Healthy).  
 Visualize predictions and use Grad-CAM for interpretability.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- OpenCV
- Pandas, Numpy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## 📂 Dataset
We use **labeled CT scan datasets** with categories including:
- COVID-19 Positive
- Pneumonia
- Normal (Healthy)

Images are processed for **consistent input size and quality**, ensuring robust model training and evaluation.

## 📊 Results
 Achieved **high accuracy on validation and test sets**.  
 Clear visualizations of predictions with confidence scores.  
 Model explainability using Grad-CAM heatmaps for decision transparency.
